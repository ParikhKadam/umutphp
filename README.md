### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I spent 18 years pursuing a career on software development including e-commerce sites, content management systems, product information management systems, dating sites, learning management systems and corporate multi-layer web applications. In the early stages of my career, I involved in every steps of the software development cycle. Then, I focused on the software design and implementation.

Currently, I am involved in building and improving teams to create better solutions for Sony from the recruitment steps to the performance reviews. I also participate in the discussions and solutions of the software projects that my teams are responsible for.

My technology stack is totally based on open source technologies because I totally agree that the open source software model encourages freedom, collaboration and creativity.
